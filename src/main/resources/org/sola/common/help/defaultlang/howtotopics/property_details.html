        <h1>Property Details</h1>

        <p>The Property Details screen allows you to create new property records or edit the details 
            of an existing property. You can access the Property Details screen in view only mode by 
            opening a search result from the Property Search screen. To edit property details, you must first
            lodge an application that contains a Registration Service such as New Digital Title (used to create new property records) 
            or Register New Ownership, Register Mortgage, etc assign the application and then Start the service from the Application Details Service tab. 
            The Land Registration How To section discusses how to process various Registration Services using the Property Details screen.

        <p>A property in the context of the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM - draft ISO standard
            19152) is a Basic Administrative Unit (a.k.a. BA Unit). In a title registration system, it is 
            the title. In line with LADM, the BA Unit is uniquely identifiable 
            and links parcels to their applicable Rights, Restrictions and/or Responsibilities 
            (a.k.a. RRR) for the purposes of registration with a land administration agency. 
            A property links the rights and restrictions over a parcel to the individuals or groups 
            (i.e. parties) that hold those rights. The information represented by the property is often referred to as the Title. 
            Details that can be captured for a property include: <br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>General &#8211; General information about the property like the two part property reference (Parcel Number and Upi Ward Code), 
                right, status, area and description as well as documents relevant to the property. <br>
            </li>

            <li>Parcels &#8211; The area(s) of land that define the extent of a property. Parcels 
                can be spatially defined and/or textually described. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Rights, Restrictions & Responsibilities &#8211; The rights, restrictions or 
                responsibilities the right holder(s) are accorded in relation to the parcels 
                represented by the property.  These could be ownership rights, lease rights, 
                mortgage rights, mining rights, access rights, servitudes, building restrictions, 
                land use restrictions, caveats, etc.  <br>
            </li>
            <li>Ownership &#8211; Typically the primary right for a property is the right of ownership. 
                Properties can have one or many owners each with a share in the property that may be 
                implicitly defined or undivided. Note that changes in ownership are captured using the 
                Ownership right on the Rights / Restrictions tab of the Property Details screen. 
                The Ownership tab is provided on the Property Details screen to quickly view ownership 
                history. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Notations &#8211; Short comments recorded when changes are made to the property that 
                provide a succinct history of the changes. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Property history &#8211; Shows the list of parent properties (if any) that are superseded by the property 
                (i.e. Prior Title) along with the list of child properties (if any) that the property has been superseded by when the property was terminated. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Map &#8211; Provides the SOLA Map Viewer highlighting the parcel for the property if one exists. . 
                Recording this information can help to identify and distinguish the location of propertyâ€™s objects, both current and pending
                <br>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Right and Restriction Details</h2>
        <p>
            The Rights and Restrictions (RRR) tab shows summary information for all current and pending 
            (i.e. unregistered) rights and restrictions on the property. You can access further information about
            a specific right or restriction by selecting the RRR from the list and clicking the View toolbar button. 
            The RRR details screen displayed will be dependent on the RRR you selected, however it should contain 
            detailed information about the RRR as well as any supporting documentation that was linked to the RRR 
            when it was first recorded
            This tab also displays the Rights history for the property in the bottom section of the tab.
            You can select and View the historic rights details as required. 
            The other toolbar items available on this tab allow you to create, vary (modify) or extinguish (cancel) RRR.
            To use these toolbar items you must first lodge an application with one or more Registration Services.
            When you Start a Registration Service from the Application Details Services tab, it configures the 
            Property Details screen enabling or disabling the RRR toolbar items relevant for that service.

        <h2>Applications with Multiple Properties</h2>

        <p>SOLA allows more than one property to be associated to an application. In this situation, 
            the Select Property screen is displayed when you start a property related service allowing 
            you to select the appropriate property to work on by double clicking.</p> <br>

        <h2>Approving a Property Change</h2>

        <p>Changes made to the property such as the addition or removal of rights remain pending 
            until the application is approved. You can approve the application by completing all 
            services on the application and approving the application using the Approve tool 
            in the Application Details toolbar.</p>

        <h2>Terminate a Property</h2>

        <p>When a property has been superseded by new properties/titles and these new properties have inherited 
            its object, then it has to be terminated. You can terminate the superseded property by linking all its objects to the new properties and terminating it, once the new properties change 
            their status from pending to current, using the Terminate tool in the Property Details toolbar.</p> <br>
